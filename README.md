# **Automate-the-boring-stuffs project solutions**

Hai, I am Sidharth and I am from Palakkad Kerala. I am a first year Artificial Inteligence Engineering student.

This is a very good book. I was thrilled to read this book but unfortunatly I could do only till chapter 13 within the deadline mentioned for us. I loved the way the author tried to explain how to automate the daily boring tasks using python in a very simple way ðŸ˜Œ. I was a bigginner to python but then also I didn't face any difficulties while understanding this book.
